Note for 10/2/19
Menu:
Each column has its own class such as MenuFile, MenuEdit, etc.

getAccessibleContext().setAccessibleDescription() is called on each JMenuItem inside each class

Toolbar
Same as Menu, each column/icon has its own class such as PokeTool, EditTool, etc.

Each class inherits the Tool abstract class that also implements AttributeDefaultProvider

Tool is not a JComponent 

Tool.properties is the place where actual tooltips and names are assigned

In function getToolTip() inside the ToolItem (this is inside class LayoutToolBarModel class), ret value is where tooltips are displayed. I changed it to make it display the name, and the content of the tooltip becomes the name.

getToolTip() is called on a ToolBarItem item in the function of getToolTipText in the class ToolbarButton (a JComponent). Here it seems like the message is passed upon to java accessibility

Inside Icons class, there is the method of getIcon that returns an ImageIcon (accessible). This method seems like it is defining the shape and colour of the icon 

getIcon() mentioned above is called on an Interface Icon (not Icons), which is NOT JComponent. Here is an example: private static final Icon toolIcon = Icons.getIcon(“poke.gif") (this is inside the PokeTool class)

Misc
Ctrl-1/2/3/4/5/6/7 is how you use keyboard shortcut to navigate the icons in toolbar. (I had narrator on previously so it was a bit messed up)

At the menu bar, I modified some code so that there is tooltip (LogisimMenuBar.java)

Walk through the menu columns using alt + _ / arrow key (need a starting pt). 

Walk through the elements inside menu using arrow key / alt + _ 

LHS middle column (where you find Wiring, Gates, Plexers … ) hover on them and they will be read out

LHS lower column using arrow key and navigate the cells (starting pt needed). Info will be read out.
