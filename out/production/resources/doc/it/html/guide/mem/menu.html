        Pop-up menu
      </h2>
      <p>
        The pop-up menu for memory includes four options in addition to the options common to all components:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          <b>Edit Contents:</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Bring up a hex editor for editing the contents of memory.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>Clear Contents:</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Resets all values in memory to 0.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>Load Image...:</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Resets all values in memory based on the values found in a file using the format described below.
          </p>
        </dd>
        <dt>
          <b>Save Image...:</b>
        </dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            Stores all values in memory into a file using the format described below.
          </p>
        </dd>
      </dl>
      <h2>
        File format
      </h2>
      <p>
        The file format used for image files is intentionally simple; this permits you to write a program, such as an assembler, that generates memory images that can then be loaded into memory. As an example of this file format, if we had a 256-byte memory whose first five bytes were 2, 3, 0, 20, and -1, and all subsequent values were 0, then the image would be the following text file.
      </p>
      <blockquote>
        <pre>v2.0 raw
11 23 9*11 78 90 12 14 fe
34 ef 1 54 23 12
</pre>
      </blockquote>
      <p>
        The first line identifies the file format used (currently, there is only one file format recognized). Subsequent values list the values in hexadecimal, starting from address 0; you can place several such values on the same line. If there are more memory locations than are identified in the file, Logisim will load 0 into the other memory locations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The image file can use run-length encoding; for example, rather than list the value <tt>00</tt> sixteen times in a row, the file can include <tt>16*00</tt>. Notice than the number of repetitions is written in base 10. Files produced by Logisim will use run-length encoding for runs of at least four values.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can place comments into the file by using the '#' symbol: All characters in the line starting from the '#' symbol will be ignored by Logisim.
